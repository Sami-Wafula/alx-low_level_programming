Hello, World C

This project contains introductory C related tasks.

Tasks Completed
 0. Preprocessor
0-preprocessor runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output would be saved in the file c.
 1. Compiler
1-compiler compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
 2. Assembler
2-assembler generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
 3. Name
3-name compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
 4. Hello, puts
4-puts.c prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function puts rather than printf.
 5. Hello, printf
5-printf.c prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line using the function printf rather than the function puts. The program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option.
 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
6-size.c prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux system to test the -m32 gcc option.
 7. Intel
100-intel generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
 8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
101-quote.c prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.The functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts would not be used. The return value of the program would be 1 and would compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.
